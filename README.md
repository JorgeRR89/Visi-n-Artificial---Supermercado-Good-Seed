Computer vision project for age estimation using deep learning (ResNet50) to support legal age verification in retail environments.

This project explores the use of computer vision and deep learning to estimate a person’s age from facial images.

A convolutional neural network based on a pretrained ResNet50 architecture is used to solve the task as a regression problem, predicting continuous age values from facial features.

The objective is to support compliance with age-restricted product regulations (such as alcohol sales) in retail environments by providing an automated, preventive age verification system that assists human decision-making.

The project covers data exploration, image preprocessing, GPU-based model training, evaluation of regression metrics, and a discussion of real-world applicability and limitations.
